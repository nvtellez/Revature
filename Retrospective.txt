  Creating object 
    Quick cycles on testing
  Layout and functuality look good
  Overall went well for first project

  Went bad scrapped project after 4   hours working is sales force

    GOOD:
      Using notepad to plan wireframe helped reduce time needed to implement into salesforce.
      Used profiles and permission sets well to control object and field accessibility.
    BAD:
      Needed more UI features to showcase what I learned last week
      It was difficult to pass an object from user to user without using manual sharing.
